7.  Biometric data processing (Face Data)

7.1. What biometric data do we collect
To provide skin condition analysis services, our app uses photos of your face and other skin areas. These photos are considered biometric data, as they can be used to identify an individual. We process only those pictures that you take voluntarily through the functions of our application.

7.2. How we use your biometric data
* Skin analysis: Your photos are transmitted to our neural network (artificial intelligence) for analysis in order to generate a personal report on the condition of the skin, identify features and provide individual care recommendations.
* History generation: Your images and reports are stored locally on your device so that you can track the dynamics of skin condition changes over time.

7.3. Storage and security
* Local storage: All source photos and reports are stored exclusively on your device (on your iOS device) and are not transferred anywhere without your explicit consent for each individual operation (for example, for analysis).
* We do not create biometric templates: We do not create or store digital templates or fingerprints of your face for identification purposes.

7.4. Transfer of data to third parties
* For analysis: To process photos and generate a report, images are temporarily transferred to the secure servers of our service provider (DocsGPT Arc53 Ltd). The analysis process is fully automated, and after it is completed, the photos are immediately deleted from our servers. We do not share your biometric data with any other third parties for marketing, advertising or other purposes.
* Legal compliance: We may disclose your data only if required by law or in response to a valid judicial request.

7.5. Data retention period
* On the device: You have full control over the storage time of snapshots and reports on your device. You can manually delete them at any time through the account deletion functionality in the app.
* On our servers: As mentioned above, your photos are deleted from our servers immediately after the neural network analysis is completed and the results are sent to your device. We do not store archived copies of your biometric data on our servers.

7.6. Your rights
You can at any time:
* View all the data stored in the application.
* Delete all your data (photos and reports) by deleting the app from your device or deleting your account. Since the data is stored locally, this will lead to their complete and permanent deletion.
